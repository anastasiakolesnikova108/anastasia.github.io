        Sleeping more than 9 hours per day may benefit certain individuals, particularly those with increased physical or mental demands, like athletes or those recovering from illness. Research shows that adequate sleep is crucial for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and overall brain health. A study published in Nature found that sleep plays a vital role in clearing toxins from the brain, particularly amyloid-beta, a protein linked to Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Additionally, prolonged sleep helps in reducing stress hormone levels like cortisol, supports immune function, and improves emotional regulation. While excessive sleep might not be ideal for everyone, for some, extended sleep can help optimize physical recovery, mental clarity, and mood stability. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of consistently sleeping over 9 hours.
